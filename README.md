## Game Development

‚Ä¢ Explain what were your initial objectives (at the end of day 2) of the project and which ones did you (or not) achieve and why

‚Ä¢ In the planning phase of the process my main goal was to set the theme, the core idea, and be able to imagine what I wanted it to look and how it would work and feel. I wanted to improve the relevance of this project by adding some context that people could recognize. That's why I decided to make it referencing to this time of pandemics. I had a very clear idea of how I wanted the game, and every step in the way and the extra effort applied in graphics and interface creation was to fulfill that vision.

‚Ä¢ Designing
The designing of the game was one of the most important phases, because I had the goal to make it look and feel just like I imagined originally. I found a very good resource for many of the game assets, which helped a lot (and it is cited in ackowledgements), but there is a lot of content I created myself using Photoshop.

‚Ä¢ Development
Working with Phaser 3 was very interesting and after speding some time learning how it works you start loving it (or at least respect the work behind it). The library is amazing and it is probably one of the best tools for creating games using Javascript, which is by itself a powerful achievement.

I listed the main features I wanted in my game and went through each one of them following the information on Phaser 3 documentation. Sometimes it got confusing but after a while I became familiarized with the mindset behind the library, which helped me a lot to understand the new information I was constantly dealing with.

‚Ä¢ Deployment
The deployment was made very easy by Netlify, which dealt perfectly with the webpack configuration, the yarn setup, and the node packages.

## Built With

‚Ä¢ Phaser
‚Ä¢ JavaScript
‚Ä¢ Webpack

## Requirements

- You'll need a package manager to install the dependencies listed in package.json in order to make the game work in your local machine.

The project was built using yarn, so it's recommended to have yarn installed.

## Getting Started

- First get a local copy of the project by forking it or just clone it typing this at your terminal inside your favorite folder:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:luciano-ilha/falcon-shootergame-js.git
```

- CD into the repository
- Run `npm install`

This will install the dependencies in your local machine. This process can take a few minutes.

## Running the Game Locally
